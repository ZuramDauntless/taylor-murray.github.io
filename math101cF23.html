			<h1> MATH 101C Fall 2023  </h1>


			
		<p> 
		Welcome to MATH 101C! I will post lecture notes here. Please make sure to read the designated sections prior to the designated classes. 
        This is important as lectures will be tailored to accomodate an active learning structure. Apologies for the barren class page; hopefully, 
        as the semester progresses, I will be able to spruce it up.  
		</p>
